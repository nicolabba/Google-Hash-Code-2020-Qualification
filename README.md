# Google-Hash-Code-2020-Qualification
Attempt for the Google Hash Code 2020 Qualification Round with my colleague [Nicola](https://github.com/nicolabba).

Originally written in Kotlin, this version is a rewrite in Ruby with further improvements, which scored a total of 25,661,831 points during the extended round (ranked ~620th).

The original version scored 15,532,608 points, ranking us 5,326th among 10,724 teams, which means this one was a definite improvement.
